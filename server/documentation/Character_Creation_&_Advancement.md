## Character Creation

#### Choose Strain

Ask you GM what strains are permitted for the game and select from amongst them which one your character will be a member of. Each strain will provide various attribute bonuses and penalties as well as a number of strain specific traits.

#### Assign Attributes

Your starting attributes are set by your strain. Select one attribute to increase by one and optionally select a second attribute to increase by one and either two attributes to reduce by one or one attribute to reduce by two.

#### Choose Background Trainings

One at a time select and apply three trainings with the background tag to your character to represent their experience before beginning the campaign. Each training provides a set number of bonuses, skill ranks, traits, and new trait options for your character. Applying these trainings one at a time allows you to select trainings with prerequisites that are met by your earlier choices.

#### Starting Gear and Spells

## Beyond Starting Character Level

Character's gain new and better skills, traits, even attributes as they progress through a campaign. At various milestones of play characters should gain levels, granting them additional traits and training points; depending on the speed your game is looking to go a character may get one or more levels as often as every session or as rarely as at the end of each major chapter. Each time a character gains a level they gain one training point to be spent during downtime and one new trait to be assigned immediately. Each time a character gains a new trait they may also choose an old trait to reassign, losing the previous benefit and gaining a new one; they may not reassign a trait that is a requirement for another trait they still possess however.

#### Training points

Training points can be spent to gain training experience that your character participates in. Choose a training that you has a cost equal to or less than your total number of accrued training points and work with your GM to figure out how your character can get the training they're looking for and how much down time it may take to accomplish. These specifics will vary greatly from training to training, campaign to campaign, and group to group; for example a 1 cost 'self-taught' training can likely be done in the evenings during an active adventure while 'academy trained mage, novice' likely requires months of downtime studying at a magic academy for most groups but could be accomplished with a bag full of text books and regular correspondence with an NPC from the academy if your campaign has characters constantly on the move with no extended downtime to speak of.

#### Traits

A character has access to a variety of traits based on their strain, trainings, and level. Each time a character gains a level they may select one of the traits available to them, provided they meet all prerequisites, and immediately gain the benefits for their character, they may then choose to reassign a trait they already have, provided it is not fulfilling a prerequisite for another trait the character has, to a different trait they are eligible for exchanging the previous benefits for the new ones.
