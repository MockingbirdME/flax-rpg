When a character wishes to attempt an action where success is not certain and failure is not guaranteed, or when a characterâ€™s degree of success or failure matters, the GM may call for a skill check.

## Making a Skill Check
To perform a skill check requires a number of steps as follows:
1. Determine the relevant attribute, skill, and secondary skill, when there is no clear answer here the player and GM should try to figure out what to use together with the GM having final say.
2. Determine the difficulty of the skill check.
3. Build the die pool:
  1. Start with two standard dice.
  2. If the character has untrained level proficiency in the primary skill and has zero ranks in the secondary skill add an untrained penalty die.
  3. If the character has skilled level proficiency in the primary skill add a skilled bonus die.
  4. If the character has expert level proficiency in the primary skill add a skilled bonus die.
  5. If the character has master level proficiency in the primary skill add a mastery bonus die.
  6. Add any extra bonus or penalty dice the character gains as a result of conditions, circumstance, or action choices, make sure to keep track of which kind of dice each is.
6. Roll all dice in your die pool.
7. For each penalty die in the roll remove the highest remaining die result in your pool.
8. For each bonus die in the roll remove the lowest remaining result in your pool.
9. Sum the remaining two dice in your pool and add the character's relevant attribute's bonus/penalty to it. Make sure to note if any bonus or penalty dice, and which ones, are remaining.
10. For each non standard die used to calculate the final result determine how it affects the outcome of the skill challenge (See Below).
11. Compare the roll total to the difficulty of the skill check and determine results.

### Bonus and Penalty Die types and effects
* penalty die - subtract one from the skill check total.
* skilled die - add one to the skill check total.
* mastery die - add two to the skill check total.
* reckless die - lose one point of defense, if both dice are reckless lose one point of max defense instead.
* focus die - lose one point of willpower, if both dice are focus dice lose one point of max willpower instead.

## Difficulties:
* 6-7 - very easy
* 8-10 - easy
* 11-12 - standard difficulty for most actions.
* 13-15 - difficult
* 16-17 - very difficult
* 18+ - Extremely difficult

## Skill Check Results
* Less than difficulty - failure, the action fails possibly with additional consequences.
* Equal to difficulty -  near success, the action was not a complete success rather it either succeeded with additional consequences or brought the character closer to their goal than they were before performing the action.
* Equal to difficulty plus required successes - complete success, the action is successful.
* Greater than difficulty plus required successes - the action gains a bonus for each additional success (point by which the result exceeds the difficulty).
