## Suffering Damage
When a character suffers damage follow these steps to determine the effects:
1. Determine the type of damage being inflicted.
2. If damage type is penetrating and the total amount of damage is less than the character's *armor value* change the damage type to concussive.
3. Reduce the damage by the character's *resistance* for the specific type of damage, to a minimum of one.
4. If the character has the *weakness* trait for the damage type double the remaining damage.
5. Use the rules below to apply the appropriate effects based on the damage type.

### Concussive
Reduce the targets stamina by the amount of damage inflicted, if this damage reduces the character to 0 stamina inflict one wound then reset the character's stamina to its current max, and inflict the remaining damage, repeat until the damage has all been inflicted.


### Penetrating
If the total damage is less than the target's max stamina reduce their max stamina by 1, otherwise the target suffers wounds equal to the total damage divided by the target's max stamina, ignoring any remainder.

## Effects of being wounded
Each time a character suffers a wound reduce their max stamina and max defense, additionally characters suffer progressively sever conditions depending on how badly wounded they are:
* **Wounded, Lightly -** A character who has suffered at least one wound is light wounded.
* **Wounded, Moderately -** A character who has suffered at least half their *max wounds* is moderately wounded.
* **Wounded, Severely -** A character has suffered a number of wounds equal to their *max wounds* is severely wounded.
* **Wounded, Mortally -** A character who has suffered more wounds than their *max wounds* is mortally wounded.

## Conditions
* **Exhausted 1 -** The character suffers one penalty die to all skill checks unless they spend one stamina or willpower.
* **Exhausted 2 -** The character suffers two penalty dice to all skill checks unless they spend one stamina or willpower.
* **Exhausted 3 -** The character suffers two penalty dice to all skill checks unless they spend one max stamina or max willpower.
* **Fatigued 1 -** When the character spends one or more stamina, they must spend an additional one stamina or willpower.
* **Fatigued 2 -** When the character spends one or more stamina or willpower, they must spend an additional one stamina or willpower.
* **Fatigued 3 -** When the character spends one or more stamina, max stamina, willpower, or max willpower, they must spend an additional one max stamina or max willpower.
* **Wounded, Lightly -** The character can not recover the max stamina or defense lost by having suffered wounds.
* **Wounded, Moderately -** The character can not recover the max stamina or defense lost by having suffered wounds and gains one penalty die to each of their skill checks.
* **Wounded, Severely -** The character can not recover the max stamina or defense lost by having suffered wounds and gains two penalty dice to each of their skill checks.
* **Wounded, Mortally -** The character can not recover the max stamina or defense lost by having suffered wounds and gains two penalty dice to each of their skill checks, these penalty die cannot be reduced or ignored by spending willpower. Additionally, unless they are stabilized they must make a <SOME KIND OF SKILL CHECK where a failure means death, a near success is an extra wound, a success is the loss of one max stamina> each round.
