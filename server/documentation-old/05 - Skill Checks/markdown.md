When a character wishes to attempt an action where success is not certain and failure is not guaranteed, or when a characterâ€™s degree of success or failure matters, the GM may call for a skill check.

## Making a Skill Check
To perform a skill check requires a number of steps as follows:
1. Determine relevant attribute and skill.
2. Determine difficulty and required successes.
2. Determine bonus and penalty dice - a character gains a penalty die if they are not proficient in the relevant skill, gains bonus dice for each rank of proficiency beyond the first and may gain any number of either from situational benefits. If a character has both bonus and penalty dice they remove one of each until only one or the other is being added to the skill check.
3. Roll 2d10 + 1d10 for bonus or penalty die in the skill check.
4. Select two dice from the roll, the lowest two if the roll has any penalty dice in it otherwise the highest two.
5. Add the character's relevant attribute's bonus/penalty to the sum of the two dice selected from the previous step.
6. Compare the total from step five to the difficulty of the skill check and determine results.

## Difficulties:
* 6-7 - very easy
* 8-10 - easy
* 11-12 - standard difficulty for most actions.
* 13-15 - difficult
* 16-17 - very difficult
* 18+ - Extremely difficult

## Skill Check Results
* Less than difficulty - failure, the action fails possibly with additional consequences.
* Equal to difficulty -  near success, the action was not a complete success rather it either succeeded with additional consequences or brought the character closer to their goal than they were before performing the action.
* Equal to difficulty plus required successes - complete success, the action is successful.
* Greater than difficulty plus required successes - the action gains a bonus for each additional success (point by which the result exceeds the difficulty).
