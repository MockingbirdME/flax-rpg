Most of the game is played with no set turns or timing to most actions, or at the very least said timing is implied and loosely tracked by the Players and GM as works best for the story. There are times however when specific timing and action tracking become more important, this is most often when a fight starts but could also be used in other time sensitive situations such as when taking actions to disarm a trap before it kills the party or when trying to stop some disaster at the eleventh hour to save a village. During these times the game can transfer into turn based combat where characters, or groups of characters, take turns in initiative order. 

## Initiative
When combat starts order all characters, groups are commonly used for plentiful NPCs/enemies, based on their initiative attributes. Any character aware that combat is about to start my choose to sacrifice one or more actions for each turn they take during the first round of combat to increase their starting initiative by 3 per action sacrificed in this way. 

### Initiative ties
When initiative is first determined there may be ties between multiple characters, if a player character is involved in a tie allow them to decide the order characters at that initiative will act, otherwise the GM can determine it between NPCs. If a character's initiative changes resulting in a tie that character goes last at that initiative value unless the effect that changed their initiative specifically states otherwise. 

### Setting initiative
Some effects may set a character's initiative to a different value, most commonly this happens when a character takes the delay turn action or when they end their turn with an initiative value of greater than 10 and have their initiative automatically set to 10 less than its current value.

### Increasing initiative
Some effects or abilities allow a character to increase their initiative, these effects always take place at the end of that character's turn and initiative continues from where in the turn order that character began their turn not their new location. Initiative values greater than 10 should be reserved for the beginning of combat, as such any effect that would increase a character's initiative to 11 instead _"increases"_ their initiative to one, allowing them to act again on the same round of combat, and continues any additional increase from there. 

### Decreasing initiative
Some effects lower a characters initiative, when a character's initiative is lowered this can cause them to appear like they should act sooner than they  would have if their initiative was not lowered, when this happens that character's next turn is skipped. As no character can have an initiative value of 0 or less if a character's initiative would be reduced to zero place them at initiative value 10 and continue any reductions from there. 


## Combat Round

## Character Turn
A character's turn follows the following steps:
1. Recover one stamina.
2. Gain a number of Action Points based on their character type trait (3 for adventurer).
3. Take any number of actions provided the character has action points remaining.
4. Remove any unspent action points.
5. If the character's initiative value is greater than 10 set their initiative value to 10 less than its current value.
6. Move to the next character's turn in initiative order.

## Actions
### Multi-Action Penalty
Many actions taken in combat are complicated, requiring a skill check to determine if, and by how much, the action succeeds. Due to the complexity of these actions the character suffers one penalty die to every skill check made in a turn for every skill check they have already made that turn, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the action's description. Similarly, a character making multiple skill checks outside of their turn suffers one penalty die to every skill check for each skill check they have made since the end of their last turn.
