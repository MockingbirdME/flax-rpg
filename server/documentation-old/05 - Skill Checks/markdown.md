When a character wishes to attempt an action where success is not certain and failure is not guaranteed, or when a characterâ€™s degree of success or failure matters, the GM may call for a skill check.

## Making a Skill Check
To perform a skill check requires a number of steps as follows:
1. Determine the relevant attribute and skill, when there is no clear answer here the player and GM should try to figure out what to use together but the GM has final say.
2. Determine the difficulty of the skill check.
3. Determine if the dice involved in this skill check are 0 indexed or 1 indexed. If a character is not proficient in the primary skill they use 0 indexed dice for this roll, otherwise they use one indexed dice; 0 indexed dice treat a result of '0' on each die as equal to zero, while one indexed dice treat it as equal to ten.
4. Determine bonus and penalty dice - a character gains expertise bonus dice for each rank of proficiency beyond novice, one for skilled, two for expert, and 3 for master. Any given skill check may gain a variety of of bonus or penalty dice from status effects, situational advantages/disadvantages, or character abilities.
5. Build your die pool. This always contains 2 standard dice, as well as all bonus or penalty dice added to the roll. Make sure you know which dice are standard, penalty, and each type of bonus you have in the roll.
6. Roll all dice in your die pool.
7. For each penalty die in the roll remove the highest remaining die result in your pool.
8. For each bonus die in the roll remove the lowest remaining result in your pool.
9. Sum the remaining two dice in your pool and add the character's relevant attribute's bonus/penalty to it. Make sure to note if any bonus or penalty dice, and which ones, are remaining.
10. For each non standard die used to calculate the final result determine how it affects the outcome of the skill challenge (See Below).
11. Compare the roll total to the difficulty of the skill check and determine results.

### Bonus and Penalty Die types and effects


## Difficulties:
* 6-7 - very easy
* 8-10 - easy
* 11-12 - standard difficulty for most actions.
* 13-15 - difficult
* 16-17 - very difficult
* 18+ - Extremely difficult

## Skill Check Results
* Less than difficulty - failure, the action fails possibly with additional consequences.
* Equal to difficulty -  near success, the action was not a complete success rather it either succeeded with additional consequences or brought the character closer to their goal than they were before performing the action.
* Equal to difficulty plus required successes - complete success, the action is successful.
* Greater than difficulty plus required successes - the action gains a bonus for each additional success (point by which the result exceeds the difficulty).
