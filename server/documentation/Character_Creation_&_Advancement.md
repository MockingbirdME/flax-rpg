## Character Creation

#### Choose Strain

Ask you GM what strains are permitted for the game and select from amongst them which one your character will be a member of. Each strain will provide various attribute bonuses and penalties as well as a number of strain specific traits.

#### Assign Attributes

Your starting attributes are set by your strain. Select one attribute to increase by one and optionally select a second attribute to increase by one and either two attributes to reduce by one or one attribute to reduce by two.

#### Choose Backgrounds

One at a time select and apply three backgrounds to your character to represent their experience before beginning the campaign. Each background provides a set number of bonuses, skill ranks, and traits for your character.

#### Starting Gear and Spells

## Beyond Starting Character Level

Character's gain new and better skills, traits, even attributes as they progress through a campaign. At various milestones of play characters should gain levels, granting them additional traits; depending on the speed your game is looking to go a character may get one or more levels as often as every session or as rarely as at the end of each major chapter. Each time a character gains a level they gain one new trait. Each time a character gains a new trait they may also choose an old trait to reassign, losing the previous benefit and gaining a new one; they may not reassign a trait that is a requirement for another trait they still possess however.

#### Training Time

#### Traits

A character has access to a variety of traits based on their strain and level. Each time a character gains a level they may select one of the traits available to them, provided they meet all prerequisites, and immediately gain the benefits for their character, they may then choose to reassign a trait they already have, provided it is not fulfilling a prerequisite for another trait the character has, to a different trait they are eligible for exchanging the previous benefits for the new ones.
