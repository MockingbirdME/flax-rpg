Mages can wield and shape arcane energy in one of two ways, they can cast practiced spells and cantrips or they can draw upon raw arcane power to be shaped and molded by their will.

## Casting Methods
#### Crafting Effects
By first gathering arcane energy before shaping it as they desire a mage can make any effect they have the skill for, however doing so has additional risks as magic is as much art as science and the amount of power unleashed can be uncertain.
#### Spells
The most common and safest way for a mage to bend reality is by practicing specific effects until they become rote.
#### Cantrips
Cantrips are simple spells that the mage has worked with so many times they no longer require a skill check to cast and have a set stamina cost.

## Complicated Magic
#### Prolonged Arcane Manipulation
#### Group Arcane Manipulation

## Creating Spells and Cantrips
All spells start with a Stamina Cost of 0, an Arcane Pool of 0, and a Range of Touch. The spell is then developed by adding effects to the spell from amongst those the mage has access too. Each effect has an arcane cost associated with it, this cost is added to the spell's arcane pool.

## Arcane Effects
Many Arcane effects are available to all mages regardless of specialty or skill level others are associated with a specific Arcane Power. Arcane Powers are each associated with one or more Arcane Themes. For a mage to have access to the arcane effects of a specific arcane power they must have a mage trait that gives them access to effects from that power or one of its associated themes.

## Spell, Cantrip, and Crafted Effect Building
When building a spell, cantrip, or crafting an effect there are a number of steps to be followed:
  1. Select one range effect the caster has access to.
  2. Select one speed effect the caster has access to.
  3. Select one delay effect the caster has access to.
  4. Select one components effect the caster has access to.
  4. Select any number of other effects the caster has access to.
  5. Sum the arcane cost of all effects in the cantrip, spell, or crafted effect.
  6. For spells and crafted effects the total arcane cost, modified by any relevant traits or other abilities the character has, is the amount of arcane dues the character suffers. Cantrips do not inflict arcane dues.
  7. For spells the total arcane cost plus ???, modified by any relevant traits or other abilities the character has, is the spells difficulty to cast.

Arcane effects are listed in the following format:
- *Effect Name (Effect's Arcane Cost)*
  - Limitations: Extra limits on the use of the effect.
  - Theme(s): What arcane theme(s) this effect is linked to.
  - Description: Description of the effect in a spell or cantrip.
